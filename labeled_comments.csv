Steve Kerr: ""You know they say that all USA Basketball players are created equal, but you look at Lebron and you look at Tatum and you can see that statement is **not true**. See, normally if you go compete for playing time on the USA roster with another guy, you got a 50/50 chance of either playing or getting benched. But Lebron a **39 year old GENETIC FREAK and he's not normal!** So you got a 25%, **AT BEST**, to take his spot. 

Then you add Steph, Embiid, Durant and Haliburton to the mix, your chances of getting minutes drastically go down. See at the Olympic Games, you got a 33 1/3 chance of getting time, but Lebron, **LEBRON got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning**, because Tyrese **KNOWS** he can't beat Lebron and he's not even gonna try!

So Tatum, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus Lebron's 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance at getting **ANY** playing time. But then you take Lebron's 75% chance of winning and then add 66 2/3 per cents, he's got **141 2/3 chance** of winning Gold at the Olympics.

Ant has been balling, KD has been balling... i'd advocate at Kerr dropping Embiid/Steph from the starting lineup and replacing them with either Ant/KD and AD, but for some reason the 2nd unit has really clicked, like the pieces fit better than the first unit, you don't necessarily want to mess with what's working - if the first unit could ever put their foot on a team's neck early, the game would be a wrap, but the 2nd unit so far seems to be the fireman unit, putting out the fire and digging us out of holes.

Since the Celtics bubble team that lost the ECF, every player has been replaced other than JT and JB, and yet they have still been a winning team.  

Tatum is an easy star to build a roster around because he's a very complete player who trusts his teammates and doesn't break the team scheme to put up stats and highlights.  Unlike many players of his stature, he isn't a diva and is extremely coachable.  Zero off court controversy, zero team drama.  Takes excellent care of his body, and has played in 96% of possible cames fir his career.

I'd take a boring corny dork who plays like an adult over a one dimensional team cancer like Ja Harden Embiid or Dame  any day of the week.

1013,"People need to understand that USA basketball is different. They need to make a team, and have very little time to do it. That’s why Jrue and White have been so important. 

Now, Devin Booker is criminally underrated on this board, but he also understood this better than anyone. 

Knowing that this was going to be Lebron, Steph, and KD’s team - he said months ago he’d be the best glue player on the team. And because he came in with a defined and selfless role - and has been doing it extremely well, he’s been awarded with essentially the most playing time. Honestly it should be something to teach all basketball players. Especially the best player on the team..

Ant came in ready to pick a fight about starting, which immediately meant he wasn’t going to. 😂 because USA basketball is about pecking order. However, getting to come off the bench and be #2 to KD, probably makes him feel better. And microwave off the bench is a role a team needs that he fit in well with. 

Tatum is different though. I think he just doesn’t know what his role should be. And that puts him on the bench.",neutral,0.5202403664588928

Strategy and matchup should dictate lineups and minutes, not individual performance. The converse is also true, just because you get more minutes doesn't mean you are the better player. It's just strategy and matchups. This is not rocket science. 

Either you are bigger than the team or the team is bigger than you. No ifs and buts. People talking about being 'a competitor'. If you are a real competitor you do everything to make the team win, including not playing and being happy about it.

And this is not about Tatum, which actually sounds pretty respectful when you look at the full quote. The whole NBA has this toxic culture imo. That's why Manu coming off the bench is being praised, because he's doing the normal thing that most NBA players can't do - sacrificing his minutes for the greater good.",negative,0.5228861570358276
