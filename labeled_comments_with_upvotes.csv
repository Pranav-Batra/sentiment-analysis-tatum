Then you add Steph, Embiid, Durant and Haliburton to the mix, your chances of getting minutes drastically go down. See at the Olympic Games, you got a 33 1/3 chance of getting time, but Lebron, **LEBRON got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning**, because Tyrese **KNOWS** he can't beat Lebron and he's not even gonna try!

So Tatum, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus Lebron's 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance at getting **ANY** playing time. But then you take Lebron's 75% chance of winning and then add 66 2/3 per cents, he's got **141 2/3 chance** of winning Gold at the Olympics.
